The dataset used for this project is the Breast Cancer Wisconsin (Diagnostic) Data Set.

The features in this dataset are computed from a digitized image of a fine needle aspirate (FNA) of a breast mass. They describe characteristics of the cell nuclei present in the image.

A fine needle aspiration is a procedure used to extract a sample of breast tissue from a tumor for cancer testing.

Tumors can be either malignant or benign. Malignant tumors are cancerous, while benign tumors are not.
